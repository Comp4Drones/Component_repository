## Objective

SW component that implements video analysis algorithms based on Deep Learning approaches. It will be used to process RGB (mainly) and infrared (eventually) images.

## Individual technical contribution

Definition, training and implementation of AI based algorithms for targets detection, localization and classification. Segmentation will be considered as well.
Such SW component will be defined as much general as possible but its implementation and demonstration will be done in the scope of the Smart Agriculture use case. In more detail, it will be used to monitor crop and to detect relevant information concerning plants status 

## Input

- Video streams collected by onboard cameras
- Other data collected by the drones (e.g. GPS position)

## Output

- Detection and localization of targets. Such targets will be defined in details according to the applicative requirements defined in UC5.
- Detection of relevant information about targets (e.g. size). Such information will be defined in details according to the applicative requirements defined in UC5.
