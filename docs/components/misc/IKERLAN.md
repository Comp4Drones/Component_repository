Analysis of current Safety Standards will be done, and appropriate Safety Concept will be conducted on the development of the HW/SW elements necessary to execute the Safety Function.

The Safety function will integrate several sensors to detect obstacles and avoid causing harm to goods or people. As an end point a HW/SW module that implements the Safety Function will be developed.

Emergent MPSoC technologies will be used to have powerful computation capabilities.

Lidar/radar  D&A  => update next week
