Analysis of current Safety Standards will be done, and appropriate Safety Concept will be conducted on the development of the HW/SW elements necessary to execute the Safety Function.

The Safety function will integrate several sensors to detect obstacles and avoid causing harm to goods or people. As an end point a HW/SW module that implements the Safety Function will be developed.

Emergent MPSoC technologies will be used to have powerful computation capabilities.

Lidar/radar  D&A  => update next week

The Ikerlan MAMMUT SoM enables the use of heterogeneous computing capabilities in drone systems. These systems traditionally have a limited computing power to
execute complex algorithms, such as obstacle detection and avoidance, object recognition or neural network execution, and process data from sensors such as cameras or LiDARs.  The Mammut SoM enables the integration of those functionalities.

The SoM has been designed with modularity and reusability in mind. For such purposes, it follows [SMARC standard](https://sget.org/), a SGET association standard which establishes the size, functionality, electric characteristics and pinout for embedded computer modules. This allows the reuse of the SoM in different use-cases, exchanging the Carrier Board where is plugged. Thanks to this, the user can cut the development time, allowing a shorter time to market and overall development cost of new products and solutions.

In the project scope, provides hardware blueprint for testing and integrating the modular approach of the reference architecture, that is composed of different building blocks.
