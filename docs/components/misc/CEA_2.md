# Reference Architecture Modelling and Code Generation 

The current embedded architectures of drones are organized in loosely coupled monolithic boards. Each board composed of processor, memory and communication resources (e.g. flight control, planning boards). This separation ensures that the subsystems operate almost independently from each other and avoids interference coming from the other parts. However, this approach does not support the continuous development of drone applications such as the ever-increasing demand on autonomy. The COMP4DRONES project will face this challenge by developing a compositional and integrated drone embedded reference architecture following the IMA principles, adapted to, and still considering, the drone resource constraints.


With the support of WP6 tools, CEA will enable:

- The modelling of the compositional and integrated drone embedded reference architecture.
- The generation of well-formed and semantically-correct ROS code from this architecture.
