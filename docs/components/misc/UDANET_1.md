## Objective

An energy management system is vital to optimize the energy life and the purpose of the system: it will continuously monitor important system parameters, while dealing with the varying power demands of the many aspects, the objectives of the mission and optimizing the usage of the energy. 
The designed predictive energy management system will be verified and tested via Software in The Loop.

## Individual technical contribution

- We seeks to find control inputs and vehicle trajectory between initial and final configurations that minimize the consumed energy during a specific mission.
- Energetic Model Formulation: drone dynamic model, actuators and battery (or energy souce) dynamic.
- Optimal energy trajectory planning will be formulated as a minimization problem, by which the final consumed energy is used as the cost function. In addition the state variables and control variables in are constrained to satisfy the vehicle and battery dynamics, boundary conditions.

## Input

The mission data: for example initial and final positions, time interval etc.

## Output

Control inputs that rule the motion and vehicle trajectory to optimize energy consumption
