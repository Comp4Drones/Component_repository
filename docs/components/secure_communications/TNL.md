Robust communications by means of store- and forwarding methods, using mechanisms from Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN). Focus is on collection of sensors observations in areas where standard connectivity may be limited. Robust interrupt and tolerant communication system. Study of components, methods algorithms, leading to a small-footprint implementation. 

Specific focus: quality of service methods (priority classes), routing algorithms  (in drone context) (static, epidemic, spray-and-wait) and the possibility to create the functionality in embedded systems with small footprint
