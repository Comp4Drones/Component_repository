Hyperspectral cameras can improve detection of material imperfections. The hyperspectral payload will be based on imec’s uav platform: (dual)mosaic sensors/cameras with Ximea break out board and Jetson TX2 board. Regarding the software blocks, we will reuse Airobot’s server based interface for ground controller with imec’s camera commands.
The hardware hyperspectral payload is able to communicate with the AiroCore platform. Making a rugged box:  hyperspectral measurements for detecting and quantifying corrosion damage on offshore structures in realistic conditions (wind up to 5 Beaufort, wave heights of 1,2-1,5m, minimum temperature of -10°C).
