# Hyperspectral image processing

The goal is to use hyperspectral camera data for future navigation : localization and detection. imec will reuse the hyperspectral processing software pipeline as a start base and rely on the in-house built Quasar programming framework to efficiently implement algorithms on the Nvidia Jetson boards.
The integration of algorithms to restore hyperspectral images by removing image degradations caused by vibrations, wavelength dependent fading and spectral changes due to lighting conditions.
Automatic hyperspectral image based detection and quantification of corrosion using AI technology with an accuracy of 80% compared to human inspections.
