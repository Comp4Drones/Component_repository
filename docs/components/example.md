# Description

_What is your component ? Explain clearly what is it and its purpose._

The BigFlop (_just a random name_) is a small compute platform that performs computing intensive tasks. It can be embedded in a drone thanks to its small weight of only 31g, and its small form factor of 80x50x5 millimeters, and has multiple communication ports : UART, I2C, USB, and a standard [camera serial interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_Serial_Interface) CSI-2.

An SDK is provided to program the BigFlop with your own software. The SDK include librarie for common tasks:

- serialization with [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)
- image processing with [OpenCCV](https://opencv.org/)
- an other amazing  stuff


## Current state

_What is the current state of this component?_

A prototype development version of the BigFlop is currently beeing produced, and the SDK is started.


## Improvements

_What improvements will you bring during the time of the C4D project?_

The electronics design will be validated, and a new, more compact version of the BigFlop will be designed and produced in small series.

The SDK should reach V1.0.

The product should be usable, and will be distributed to beta testers. Based on the return of experience of the beta testers, the finale product will be commercialized by June 2021.
