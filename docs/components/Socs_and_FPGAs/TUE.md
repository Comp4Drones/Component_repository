# A compact, lightweight platform (MPSOC FPGA-based, incl. RTOS)

## hardware

- Providing a composable and predictable Multi Processor System On Chip (MPSOC) implemented on FPGA.
- Providing a real-time micro kernel to manage virtualization and resource management in mixed criticality systems.
- Providing the development and analysis toolchain for implementing real-time systems software on MPSOC.


## Very accurate real-time interface/library for integration with above platform, Linux, and/or ROS

1. Providing a predictable software framework based on ROS2 for developing real-time software for robotic systems. 
2. Modeling and analysis of the real-time behaviour of the robotic systems 
3. Proving a real-time messaging framework for robot to robot communication based on Data Distribution Service (DDS) protocol.
