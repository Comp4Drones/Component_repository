# Efficient digital implementation of controllers

Efficient digital implementation of controllers, designed on the basis of a discreteâ€“time models, on FPGAs.
In order to operate safely, the controller shall enable the functionality of compensating and rejecting environmental perturbations, measurement uncertainties, and possible faults.
Increased performance of the controller, with reduced response time.
Robustness of the controller with respect to environmental disturbances and increased resiliency.
