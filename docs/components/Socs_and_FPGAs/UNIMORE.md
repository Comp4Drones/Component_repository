# Onboard Compute Platform Desing Methodolgy

Definition of Onboard Compute Platforms (based on commercial off-the-shelf, heterogeneous FPGA SoCs) and methodologies for the deployment of specialized cluster-based, accelerator architecture templates. Compute Platform design should enable easily accessible acceleration for computationally intensive algorithms for Flight Navigation, Positioning, Coordination and Communication.

Improvements compare state-of-the-art Onboard Compute Platform are expected in terms of more computational power present on board; a wider set of services and complex algorithms runnable on board; an easy to use deployment methodology for the definition of application-specific accelerated services.
