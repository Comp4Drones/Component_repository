## Requirements

__UC5-FNC-005__: The system SHALL enable advanced on board computation by means of dedicated and optimized accelerators.

__UC5-FNC-005__: The accelerator shall be built in an energy-and performance-aware manner and, where possible, should support different erformance trade-off and/or functionalities.


## Specification

Onboard computing platforms implementing different working points (i.e. trade-offs among Quality of Service and Energy consumption) or functionalities (i.e. different convolutional kernels).

## Improvements

Extended computational power by leveraging on heterogeneous co-processing units that shall enable advanced and flexible on board computation. Connection with WP4 will lead to integrate this adaptive acceleratores into a more advanced computing infrastructure by integrating it with WP3-22.
