# Onboard Compute Platform Design Paradigm

Onboard computing platforms implementing different working points (i.e. trade-offs among Quality of Service and Energy consumption) or functionalities (i.e. different convolutional kernels).

Extended computational power by leveraging on heterogeneous co-processing units that shall enable advanced and flexible on board computation. Connection with WP4 will lead to integrate this adaptive accelerators into a more advanced computing infrastructure.
