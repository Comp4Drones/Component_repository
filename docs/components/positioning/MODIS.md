Highly embedded customizable platform for SLAM technique, equipped with  magnetometers, compasses, GPS (optional), a gyroscope, accelerometer. Additionally the board will be provided with a serial communication bus (or more than one), e.g. USART, SPI, MavLink and a 32-bit MCU.
Orientation capabilities through geomagnetic field mapping with similar or higher accuracy to GPS when in GPS-loss navigation and improved precision when GPS is active
Improved algorithms for real-time data analytics, and data compression.
