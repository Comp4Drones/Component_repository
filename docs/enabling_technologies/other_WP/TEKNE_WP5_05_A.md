The component is based on the LP-WAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) LoRaWAN (LoRa Network) technology.The end-nodes, UAVs and also UGVs (Unmanned Ground Vehicle), connect to the Gateways through LoRaWAN. The Gateways are connected to the Network Server through Internet. The Network Server has two functions: (1) management of the network, and (2)support of the bidirectional messaging to and from end nodes. The second function uses the MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) protocol: end-nodes becomes MQTT publisher and their properties and methods can be accessed by any authorized MQTT publisher.The component includes an Application Server that connects to the Network Server, and that allows authorized interaction with the vehicles using any Web browser.
